**WIDER FACE: A Face Detection Benchmark** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is applicable or relevant across various domains. 

The dataset consists of 32203 images with 199130 labeled objects belonging to 1 single class (*face*).

Images in the WIDER FACE dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 16097 (50% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 3 splits in the dataset: *test* (16097 images), *train* (12880 images), and *val* (3226 images). Alternatively, images could be split into 60 ***event*** categories, while every object contains information about its ***pose***, facial ***expression***, ***occlusion***, ***blur***, and ***illumination***. Objects with low resolution and small scale receive an ***invalid*** flag. The dataset was released in 2016 by the Chinese University of Hong Kong and Shenzhen Institutes of Advanced Technology, China.
